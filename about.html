I developed a few YAML pipelines across the DEV and QA environment that created and pushed a docker image to an Azure WebApp. I also was exposed to terraform at this time. Later I began working more as a backend engineer, developing Spring services that interact with a blockchain network. I also work with the blockchain.</p>

In this role I developed numerous ETL processes, views and tables. My scrum team was primarily focused on delivering data to client reports. Some of the views I created had quite complex calculations that needed to be done, like having nested window functions. I also worked with Spring microservices in this role as well, with the main purpose of sending JSON formatted data.</p>

With my Physics minor, I got to take a research class that gave me a real appreciation for data processing and data analytics. In my junior year I took Programming Languages, we would code in a different language every two weeks which was so much fun. However, my two favorite courses were Software Development, and Software Engineering. Each course, we were placed randomly in a 3 person team and asked to develop a product in 8 weeks.</p>
